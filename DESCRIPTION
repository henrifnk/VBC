Description:A vine copulaâ€“based approach for bias correction of
    high-resolution climate model data using observations. The method
    corrects systematic biases while explicitly preserving the internal
    variability of the climate model. It is tailored for multivariate
    climate variables at fine temporal scales, including those with
    zero-inflation such as precipitation or radiation. To facilitate
    evaluation and comparison with alternative correction techniques, the
    package provides several post-hoc diagnostic measures. These include
    the Model Concordance Index (MCI), which quantifies how well the rank
    structure of the original model data is preserved, and Wasserstein
    metrics, which assess the distributional distance between corrected
    and observed data.
