Description: vineBC implements a method to correct the bias in simulated
  climate data with observed data while preserving the internal variability of
  the model. To evaluate the method and compare it with others, several post hoc 
  diagnostic measures are provided. The MCI is a measure to evaluate how well
  the correction method preserved the rank structure of model data. Wasserstein
  metrics can be calculated to determine, how distant the distributions of 
  corrected and measured data are.
