Description: A vine copula based method to correct the bias in
    high-resolution climate data with observed data while preserving the
    internal variability of a climate model. The method is designed for
    multivariate climate data at high temporal resolution. Therefore,
    climate variables like precipitation and radiation may contain
    zero-inflation. To evaluate and compare the method with others,
    several post-hoc diagnostic measures are provided. The MCI is a
    measure to evaluate how well the correction method preserved the rank
    structure of model data. Wasserstein metrics can be calculated to
    determine, how distant the distributions of corrected and measured
    data are.
